				<h2>Why Do Tune-Ups?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm sure you've heard people say "It's all about the rider not his gear."
					Well they're wrong! A good tune up will not only keep your gear in
					good condition, but will also enhance your riding ability! Whether your gear
					is cheap or expensive, you will always need to do constant tune-ups in order to
					keep your gear performing the way it's supposed to. A good tune-up will make sure 
					your gear is in safe condition for you, wax your board in order to provide a more 
					slippery bottom surface. This will help you maneuver easier and make sure you won't
					slow down while riding down. A good tune-up from us will also fix the deep scratches
					and cracks on the gear you spent so much money on! Overall, after a good tune-up, your
					gear will feel more alive and the way it's supposed to!
				</p>
				
				<h2>When Should You Do Tune-Ups?</h2>
				<p>
					So when should you do a tune-up is a question frequently asked. To determine how often
					you need a tune-up, you first have to determine what kind of rider you are. Advanced mountain
					riders such as backcountry cliff jumpers, or park riders, will have to do more frequent tune-ups
					than your average everyday cruiser. For all riders, a tune-up is mandatory at the beggning of
					every season. For advanced riders, a tune-up is necessary every 5-7 trips to the mountain. For
					an everyday cruiser, a tune-up is necessary every 7-10 trips to the slopes. Those are the most
					accurate recomendations for everyone, but if you feel like you might need a tune-up even earlier,
					it won't hurt to do one! For great performance, a pocket stone and daily wax are recommended before
					every trip to the slopes!
				</p>
