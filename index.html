					Renting gear from the Mt. Hood Ski/Snowboarding Shop will be an experience 
					like no other. Not only do we provide the best service in town, but at the lowest
					costs. Renting from us will save you time and money. The renting process is quick and 
					you won't have to deal with any long rental lines at the ski mountains. We understand
					that you would rather be out on the slopes enjoying the snow, rather than standing in line
					and wasting your time.

				<p>
					We are located in Government Camp OR, which is just accross the street from Ski-Bowl,
					and about 30 mintues from Timberline Lodge and Meadows.

					shred session, we can and will provide our best service. Check out our website for information
					on how to get started, or give us a call in the <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> section for any questions!
